# Giftastic

Overview:

Used the Giphy API to make a dynamic webpage that let users populate gifs of TV shows or Movies. With the use of Java Script and jQuery the page calls the Giphy API and changes the DOM with the data received. When the gif is displayed, it will be a still image until the user clicks on it and plays it. The User can use the buttons already created on the page or they can create their own by inputing the data.
